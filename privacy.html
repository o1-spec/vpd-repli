                        other legitimate requests for your personal data from appropriate law enforcement or
                        governmental authorities. In such situations, we will release personally identifiable data

                        financing. We will also release such personal data/information: to cooperate with law
                        enforcement or other governmental investigations (without necessarily requiring the law
                        enforcement or government agency requesting the information to formally serve us with a
                        subpoena), to comply with all valid court orders or subpoenas, to protect our legal rights

                        entity, or enters into a business combination with another entity, VPD may be required to
                        disclose some or all of your personally identifiable data to that entity to continue serving
                        you.

                    <p>
                        Customers who use the VPD system are on a secure server which encrypts all of a customer’s
                        personal data. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for a third party to access or
                        use your personal data in an unauthorized manner. VPD has developed its service with
                        security as a top priority. We use firewalls to prevent access to information in our system
                        and Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”) to encrypt your personal data and protect it from
                        disclosure, destruction, modification or use.
